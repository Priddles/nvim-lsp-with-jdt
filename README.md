# nvim-lsp-with-jdt
Test project trying to get Eclipse's Java LSP working with Neovim + vim-lsp. See [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53336434/eclipse-jdt-ls-gradle-resource-exception-invalid-project-description).

## Initialisation
In order to have a minimum viable `init.vim` and not override your current setup, dot source `env.ps1` on Windows to set the relevant XDG environment variables to the same directory as this repository.
